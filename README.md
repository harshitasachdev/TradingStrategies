# TradingStrategies

## Overview
This repository contains a trading strategy developed during my Master's in Quantitative Finance. The strategy leverages quantitative techniques and financial modeling to implement and analyze a systematic approach to trading financial assets. It incorporates advanced statistical tools, econometric modeling, and portfolio optimization techniques.

The project serves as both an academic and practical exploration of trading methodologies, providing insights into market dynamics and risk-adjusted returns.
